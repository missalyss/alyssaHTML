  <h2>I am done with coffee!</h2>
  <p>Ok, truthfully, I love coffee. It's a lot of fun to make. Also, have you tried coffee?</p>
  <p>Being a barista is both easy and taxing. The tasks aren't difficult to understand or master, but customer service can slowly drain the will the live out of you. I've seen it happen. And while I actually generally like getting to know people and talking to strangers, I've been doing customer service for at least ten years now. I'm ready for something new.</p>

  <p>I've been drawn to coding for the purpose of making a livable wage, as well as how versitle it is as a skill! Applicable in almost any industry, I can use my skills to do some real good, and become much more fulfilled than serving coffee.</p>
  <p>I got my bachelor's degree at UW in a program called Comparative History of Ideas. Basically, it was interdiciplinary in the humanities with an emphasis on social justice. I loved my education because it made me grow immensely as a person and helped me discover some of my passions. Like animals, sex ed, environmenal rights, and feminism.</p>

  <p>I've always been drawn towards education. As listed in my <a href=index.html#fun>"Fun Facts,"</a> I've found myself in multiple educational positions. My last job, for instance, I was a barista but I also was the espresso trainer for my company, going cafe to cafe, training new baristas (and retraining old ones) on how to make superior espresso. (Have a home espresso maker? I love talking about it.)</p>
  <p>While I'm very attracted to education, I've never been attracted to <strong>being a teacher</strong>.</p>
  <p>I could go on about the American education system, but the truth is that education is changing.</p>
    <h3>Education is on the Internet</h3>
    <p>Granted, for a full, in-depth understanding of something (like web development), face-to-face education cannot be beat. But the educational potential in the internet is always expanding. And I'm interested in getting involved. Whether that's to continue making videos of my beehive's progress (as people do tell me how much they learn from it) or creating a space where quality sex ed can be found.</p>
    <p>After having floated around for so long--even after getting my degree--I'm really looking forward to making a career for myself.</p>
