  <h2><a id="fun"> Some fun facts about me!</a></h2>
    <p>I have a beehive! It's called The Collective; my queen's name is Lacutus. Sometimes I snapchat my bee progress and findings.</p>
    <p>I really like comic books! My favorites are Saga, Sex Criminals, Scott Pilgrim, Lumberjanes, and Deadpool.</p>
    <p>I'm a huge Trekkie. #TNG #liveLongAndProsper</p>
    <p>I'm left handed. It's true. (You wouldn't believe how many people are amazed by this.)</p>
    <p>In big and small ways, I have done a lot of teaching. I have taught children's tap and ballet, english as a foreign language, espresso and latte art,  environmentalism 101, and sex education.</p>
    <p>I like reading things out loud.</p>
    <p>The dogs I love most (with different owners) are both named after flowers. (Rosie and Daisy)</p>
    <p>I have an elephant tattoo on my back.</p>
    <p>I am generally a weird and goofy person.</p>

    <h2>What else, Alyssa?</h2>
    <div class="family">
      <p>Although I don't get to see them as much as I'd like, I'm very close with my family. Most of them still live in Salt Lake, except for one sister in Arizona. I have two older sisters, two younger brothers, and we're all two years apart.</p>

    <div class="snowhouse">
      <p>I live in a 5 bedroom house currently filled with 4 humans, 2 chihuahuas (that I forget live there), 1 pitbull, and thousands of bees. But they have their own house outside. We are a sort of community house, with lots of people coming in and out. We call our home "Snowhouse."</p>

    <div class="brendon">
      <p>I like to spend a lot of time with my partner, and on weekends, his daughter. We're pretty goofy and have literally spent over 3 hours in a Fred Meyer before. (Not with the baby. That's crazy talk.)</p>

      <p>I love traveling and have spent time in Europe and Asia. Thailand is my favorite country so far; there I spent a month volunteering at an elephant sanctuary. I learned lots of things about elephants.</p>
